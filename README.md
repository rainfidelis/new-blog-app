# Blog Application

This is an improvement on my existing blog application developed using the django framwork. Unlike the typical django web project, though, the project was connected to the postgres database, and enjoys all of the perks that come with the database. 

The application in its current state boasts the following features:

+ A typical home page that lists all published posts.
+ An ability to leave posts as drafts
+ CRUD functionality for creating, reading and deleting blog posts
+ Search functionality to quickly locate existing blog posts
+ Ability to add comments to posts
+ Ability to add specific tags to posts and see all posts with a particular tag
+ Sitemap for web crawlers

## To Do:
I would love to add the following functionalities shortly:
+ A user dashboard with admin capabilities
+ Make image addition to the page more dynamic

## Recently Added
+ Better frontend templates for a more stylish website

## Hosting
The site is currently hosted at:
